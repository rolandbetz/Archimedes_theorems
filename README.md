# Archimedes_theorems
Proving some of Archimedes' theorems by a simple Monte Carlo simulation.

The first function, named Prove_MC1 demonstrates that if you take a cylinder,
and a sphere which matches inside the cylinder perfectly (means it touches both the
lateral surface and the bases of the cyclinder fom inside), and finally a cone, which
is also matches inside the cylinder, comparing the volumes of theese three objects
will give a proportion of 3:2:1 respectively.

The second function, named Prove_MC2 demonstrates that a sphere with the radius of 1
has a surface of 4pi, which is well known... On the other hand it also demonstrates,
that if you slice the sphere by paralell planes, which planes are in equal distances
from each other, these sections of sphere also have equal surfaces, and also...
this surface is equal to the lateral surface area of the corresponding slice of the
circumscribing cylinder.
